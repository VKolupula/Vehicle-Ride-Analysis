# Vehicle Ride Analysis

 Vehicle Dynamics is a key part of the vehicle design stage and the dynamics determine the riding comfort of the passenger and handling of the vehicle. There are many numerical simulation techniques along with theoretical calculations involved in obtaining the right vehicle dynamics configuration for a vehicle. This report discusses the parametrization of the vehicle dynamics system based on the ride comfort of passengers using a 4-DOF Vehicle model in Simulink, which is used to simulate the comfort of the entire vehicle. The primary along with secondary ride characteristics are determined and key performance indicator was obtained by varying the parameters to determine the optimized vehicle dynamics system. The sensitives were also discussed and two PID controllers individually tuned each for the front and rear wheel were used to acquire an Active Suspension system of the optimized Passive vehicle model.
