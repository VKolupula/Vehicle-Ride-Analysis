# Model-Based vehicle suspension design
 Vehicle Dynamics is a key part of the vehicle design stage and the dynamics determine the  riding comfort of the passenger and handling of the vehicle. There are many numerical simulation  techniques along with theoretical calculations involved in obtaining the right vehicle dynamics  configuration for a vehicle. This report discusses about the parametrization of vehicle dynamics  system based on the ride comfort of passengers using a 4-DOF Vehicle model in Simulink, which  is used to simulate the comfort of entire vehicle. The primary along with secondary ride  characteristics are determined and key performance indicator was obtained by varying the  parameters to determine the optimized vehicle dynamics system. The sensitives were also  discussed and two PID controllers individually tuned each for front and rear wheel were used to  acquire an Active Suspension system of the optimized Passive vehicle model.
